<h1>Black Jack Game</h1>

<p>This is a 2-player Black Jack Game that implements a dynamic user
						interface. This project was fun yet challenging as it taught me to
						think about the control flow of the program and testing for certain
						user edge cases. Making sure, the game was functional and followed
						the traditional rules of Black Jack gave me a valuable experience in
						developing applications.</p>
	<p>	The structure and styling of the webpage was built in HTML and CSS,
	while the Black Jack functionality was built with JavaScript </p>
	<p> Here is the <a href="https://zkaptan.github.io/BlackJack/" target="_blank"> link</a> to the game. I hope you enjoy!</p>
